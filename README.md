**Smart Switch Design and Development**

This project involves the development of a Smart Switch using an ESP8266 microcontroller and touch buttons. The system communicates with a mobile phone via Wi-Fi using Firebase as the backend. It automatically switches to a fallback mode when Wi-Fi is unavailable or available.  

When Wi-Fi is available, the system provides the following features:  

**Voice Control**: Users can control the switch using voice commands.  
**Scheduled Control**: Allows users to set schedules for automated switching.  
**Mobile App Control**: Users can interact with the switch directly via the mobile application or touch buttons on the device.  
When Wi-Fi is unavailable, the system automatically switches to touch-button control, ensuring basic functionality.  



**Key Interfaces in the Mobile Application**:
